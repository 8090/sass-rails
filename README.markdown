# Official Ruby-on-Rails Integration with Sass

This gem provides official integration for ruby on rails projects with the Sass stylesheet language.

## Installing

Since rails 3.1, new rails projects will be already configured to use Sass. If you are upgrading to rails 3.1 you will need to add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'sass-rails'
